## Code Style Guidelines

### General
- Use clear, descriptive variable and function names
- Keep functions focused and concise
- Add comments for complex logic
- Use consistent indentation (2 or 4 spaces)

### C++ Specific
- Use `camelCase` for variables and functions
- Use `PascalCase` for classes
- Use `UPPER_CASE` for constants
- Prefer `const` over `#define` where appropriate

### Example
```cpp
// Good
const int buttonWidth = 100;
void drawButton(int x, int y) {
  // Implementation
}

// Avoid
#define BUTTON_WIDTH 100
void draw_button(int x, int y) {
  // Implementation
}
```
